# ForzaStats

During the quarantine caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, I was trying a lot of new frameworks and languages.

Also in that period I was playing Forza Horizon 4 **a lot**. It's a really good game to play with friends, it can provide some hilarious moments and it's competitive enough to keep your hands on the controller for many hours. But, I digress.

I started building this app because I wanted to learn more about NodeJS and Electron, I learned about them while looking at VSCode and Discord, and I really liked the concept of a website on steroids. It makes the development of a GUI way simpler than something in Python for example.

It's still not finished even after more than 1 year because I have the bad habit of starting projects and leaving them in a semi-functional state: they work, but they have maybe half of the features that I planned at the beginning. One day I'll complete it, I promise. Maybe after Forza Horizon 5 gets released? I don't know if I'll buy it, if not I need to wait for another chance of 1 month of Xbox Game Pass at the incredible cost of 1â‚¬. I'll let you know.

## Features
You get basic car details and a timer to track the season progression.
Also the app shows the following stats:
- Speed
- Gear
- Engine power
- Engine RPM

It records the maximum values, so if you don't reset them using the button you can compare different cars or tunes.

## Plans
- Add a chart system using the beautiful Chart.js library
- Dark mode :new_moon_with_face:
- Record max values for every car and tune
